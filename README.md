A fully RESTful server implementation for CodeIgniter using one library, one
config file and one controller. A fork from https://github.com/philsturgeon/codeigniter-restserver

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.2 or greater
2. CodeIgniter 2.1.0 to 3.0-dev

## Installation

Drag and drop the **application/libraries/Format.php**, **application/core/MY_Model.php** and **application/core/REST_Controller.php** files into your application's directories. Additionally, copy the **rest.php** file from **application/config** in your application's configuration directory.

## Documentations?

Nah. I'm tired.
